/*
Write a program that calculates the average word length for a sentence:

    Enter a sentence: It was deja vu all over again.
    Average word length: 3.4

For simplicity, your program should consider a punctuation mark to be part of the word to
which it is attached. Display the average word length to one decimal plac–µ.
